Write a program that prints a part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 ... (the repetition is equal to the
number itself). The input of the program is a positive integer n â€“ the number of the elements of the sequence the
program should print. As the output, the sequence of numbers, written in a single line, space-separated, is expected.

For example, if n = 7, the program is to output 1 2 2 3 3 3 4.
